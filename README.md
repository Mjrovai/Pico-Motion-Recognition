<p>This Repository has the code used on the 2 parts tutorial (TO BE PUBLISHED). <p>
  
- The first one is to explore the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), its main components and how to program it, using its C/C++ SDK (Software Development Kit). 

- The Pico is used to capture "gesture data" used on a TinyML model training, using Edge Impulse Studio. Once developed and tested, the model is deployed and used for real inference on the same device.

- The project can be cloned on <a href='https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/20571/latest'>Edge Impulse Studio - Project</a>
